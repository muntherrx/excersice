# 🐚 MiniShell

## 📖 Project Overview

**MiniShell** is a lightweight Java-based command-line tool that simulates essential shell commands for navigating and manipulating the file system. It provides a minimal yet functional interface for performing operations like creating files, making directories, changing directories, and listing contents, all within the constraints of a Java application.

---

## ✨ Features

The following commands are supported:

- `pwd`: **Print Working Directory** – Displays the current absolute path.
- `ls`: **List** – Lists all files and directories in the current directory.
- `cd [directory_name]`: **Change Directory** – Navigates to the specified directory. Use `..` to go up one level.
- `mkdir [directory_name]`: **Make Directory** – Creates a new subdirectory in the current path.
- `touch [file_name]`: **Create File** – Creates a new empty file.
- `help`: **Help** – Lists all available commands with brief descriptions.
- `exit`: **Exit** – Terminates the shell session.

## 🧱 Project Structure

The codebase consists of two main classes:

### `MiniShell.java`
- Acts as the main entry point for the application.
- Uses a `Scanner` to receive user input.
- Contains a loop that:
  - Displays a prompt with the current working directory.
  - Accepts and parses user commands.
  - Delegates command execution to the `ShellCommandHandler`.

### `ShellCommandHandler.java`
- Provides the implementation for each shell-like command.
- Maintains and updates the current working directory.
- Encapsulates file system logic like listing, creating, and navigating directories and files.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### `ShellCommandHandler` Class

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `printWorkingDirectory()` | Prints the absolute path of the current directory. |
| `listDirectory()` | Lists the names of files and folders in the current directory. |
| `changeDirectory(String name)` | Changes directory to a subfolder or parent (`..`). |
| `makeDirectory(String name)` | Creates a new directory inside the current one. |
| `createFile(String name)` | Creates a new file if it doesn't already exist. |
| `printHelp()` | Displays usage information for all supported commands. |
| `getCurrentDirectory()` | Returns the current working directory as a `File` object. |

Helper Method:
- `tryCreateFile(File file)`: Handles checked exceptions during file creation.

Exiting MiniShell.
⚠️ Error Handling
The shell includes basic error handling for common situations:

Attempting to cd into a non-existent directory.

Trying to create a directory or file that already exists.

Entering unrecognized commands.

Handling IOException during file creation gracefully.

🚫 Limitations
Does not support absolute paths or complex path navigation (e.g., ../../folder).

No support for deleting, copying, or editing files.

Lacks advanced shell features like piping, redirection, or wildcard expansion.

File content manipulation is not supported (only file creation).

🔮 Future Improvements
Here are some suggested enhancements:

Add file deletion and renaming functionality.

Enable reading and writing to file content.

Improve path handling (support . and absolute paths).

Add command history and navigation.

Integrate tab completion for files and folders.

Format ls output to distinguish files and directories more clearly.
